# USA_Superstore_Analysis
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset to uncover key business insights. This project demonstrates how to visually analyze sales data across categories, states, and customer segments.

It includes dynamic charts for tracking top-selling products, sales trends, profit margins, and return rates. The dashboard allows users to filter and drill down into data for detailed analysis, helping businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.
